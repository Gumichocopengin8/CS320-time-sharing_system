# CS320 Time Sharing System

## Description 
### Problem:  
To create a simple time-sharing system.  To use the time-sharing system to “play” with the time slices to find the most efficient turnaround times using a round-robin selection algorithm.  To see what happens using time slices of varying lengths.  To allow the flexibility to build upon this time-sharing system for future projects.

Analysis:  A simple time sharing system will need several features:
-	A processor (or simulation of placing a process on the processor)
-	A waiting queue for jobs waiting for the processor
-	A selection algorithm for choosing which process gets the processor next
-	A clock with which to measure time slices
-	An Audit log to record job starting and ending times of processes

### Design/Assumptions:
These are some of the things that you may want to track in your processes.  Keep your design flexible so more items can be added later.
-	Job Number or other identification
-	Total CPU time needed to complete
-	Total CPU time completed
-	Maybe time entered onto the queue, time started on CPU, time spent waiting, and time completed.

Other design assumptions include:
-	You may use any language, on any platform of your choosing.
-	You will work in teams of 3/4, so we should have 2 teams of 4 and one of 3.
-	Processes will be loaded into the system all at once using an input file of your design.
-	You choose the number of processes to load and their running times.
-	All processes have equal priority.
-	A process running on the CPU is simply one that is pointed to by the process index and gets the processor for the amount of the time slice.
-	All processes are entirely CPU-bound.  We will not yet add interrupts for I/O.
-	You may make a fixed assumption for context switching time.
-	Assume all processes fit into main memory.  Ignore all other memory issues.
-	The clock that you use to measure time slices may be the system clock or a simple counter.
-	You will need to account for context switching time.  Every time you swap jobs on the processor, it takes a very small amount of time to save the running programs context, run the dispatcher, and restore the new processes context before it can begin running.
-	Make your selection algorithm such that it will be easy to pull out and insert a different algorithm in the future.
-	Your audit log may be a screen shot or a report.  It may be written to as processes begin and end or it may be a report done when all processes have completed.  A report upon completion may be the easiest to read and a timeline could be reconstructed.

### Deliverables:
Upon completion, please submit the following through Moodle.  This project is worth a total of 45 points.
-	Your program(s), including proper documentation for your program. In addition to documenting the code, you should have a separate design document which also includes information on building and running your simulation.  (20 points)
-	Your input file and input file format (5 points)
-	Your final audit log(s) (10 points)
-	A lab write-up containing the results that you have found and your conclusions (10 points)
-	During a lab period following the due date, you may be asked to provide a demonstration of your simulator in action and describe your design and results.
